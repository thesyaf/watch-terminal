# ⌚ Watch Terminal - "Vibe Coded"

## Overview
This is a single-page web application designed to simulate a retro terminal experience. It's intended to be served from an NFC chip embedded in a Casio watch. When scanned, it runs an initial "hacking" animation, then presents an interactive command prompt.

## Features
- Retro CRT terminal aesthetic
- Typing animation for initial sequence
- Interactive command line interface
- Basic commands: `help`, `clear`, `date`
- Designed for mobile viewing

## Access the Live App
The live application is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at:
`https://thesyaf.github.io/watch-terminal/`

## How to Use
1.  **Scan the Watch:** (Or navigate to the URL above)
2.  **Watch the Intro:** The "hacking" animation will play.
3.  **Start Typing:** After the animation, a `$` prompt will appear. Click anywhere on the terminal to ensure the input is focused, then type commands.
4.  **Available Commands:**
    *   `help`: Displays available commands.
    *   `clear`: Clears the terminal screen.
    *   `date`: Shows the current date and time.

## 🌟 Vibe Coded 🌟
This project was developed through a unique, iterative, and collaborative process, leveraging AI assistance and user feedback. It was "vibe coded," meaning its creation was driven by a fluid exchange of ideas, rapid prototyping, and a shared goal of delivering a fun and delightful user experience. Every line of code, every design choice, emerged from the collaborative "vibe" between human and AI.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Styling for the retro terminal look.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for the typing animation and interactive terminal.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files/folders to be ignored by Git (e.g., `node_modules`).
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`: Node.js project metadata (though not strictly necessary for this static site).
